# Blackjack Simulator

This is a repository for a Blackjack simulator that generates data on the effectiveness of different betting strategies. In order to run the simulator and generate the necessary data and plots, follow these steps:

## Setup

Before running the simulator, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can do this by running the following command:

```
pip3 install scipy numpy matplotlib
```

## Running the Simulator

1. Open the file `blackjack_simulator.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook or other compatible environment.
2. Run all the cells in order to generate and save the data.
3. After running the cells, you should now have the following files in your directory:
   * `balance.npy`
   * `losses.npy`
   * `wins.npy`
   * `bets.npy`

## Generating Plots

1. Open the file `Blackjack_plots.py` in a Python environment that has the required dependencies installed.
2. Run the file in order to generate the plots.

That's it! With these steps, you should be able to run the simulator and generate the necessary data and plots. Feel free to experiment with different betting strategies and parameters to see how they affect the results.
